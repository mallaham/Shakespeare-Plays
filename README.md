If you are not a big fan of Shakespeare's literature, but interested in learning some fun facts about it, you are in the right spot!


Thanks to LiamLarsen for uploading this interesting dataset [link](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays) on Kaggle. In this analysis, I'm interested to answer some of the following questions:

    - Which of all Sheakespeare plays has the largest number of actors?
    - Which of all Sheaksepeare plays has the largest number of lines?
    - Which actor(s) spoke the most number lines in each play?
    - Which actor(s) were common across all of Shakespeare plays?
    - Which actor(s) were the most influential across all the plays?
